Implementation of pure DeepAR and DeepAR with Dilated CNN. 

Data_helpers preprocess the raw data and save them by windows in .npy format.

rnn_cell_impls are modification of LSTM_Cell's source code in Tensorflow according to different models. Make sure to duplicate the original one before replacing it.

Load_DeepAR loads trained models and draw images of specified windows.
